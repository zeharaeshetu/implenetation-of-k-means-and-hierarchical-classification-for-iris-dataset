# implenetation-of-k-means-and-hierarchical-classification-for-iris-dataset

Clustering is the technique to partition data according to their characteristics. Data that are similar in nature belong to the same cluster .there are different algorithms to perform clustering.one is Hierarchical clustering it works based on the notion that the data points closer in data space exhibit more similarity to each other than the data points lying farther away. the other is K means clustering it work based on the notion that the data points closer in data space exhibit more similarity to each other than the data points lying farther away. In this paper, both hierarchical and k-means algorithms are implemented on the cluster results of the IRIS dataset. to get the optimum value of k (number of clusters) we used different methods. In the case of hierarchical clustering dendrogram method is used and for kmeans clustering Elbow method is used.
